This folder contains testing files for the locomotion subsystems and its components.

locomotion.py is a basic test file that runs the locomotion motors forward for 5 seconds
locomotion2.py tests the use of keyboard controls for the robot - works only on Windows environments
no_listener_test.py test the use of keyboard controls for the robot without a Windows only listener - works only on Ubuntu environments
locomotion_digging_test.py tests the use of both the locomotion and digging motors with the keyboard - works only on Windows environments
    NOTE - the odrives are found using the serial number of each - new controllers or not having 2 connected will cause issues
